# Hello, world! ðŸ’¥

We are going to create a simple JavaScript program, where an alert box will appear with the words 'Hello World'.

*************************************************************************

## The "Script" tag

JavaScript programs can be inserted into any part of an HTML document with the help of the `<script>` tag.

For instance:

`<!DOCTYPE HTML>`
`<html>`

`<body>`

  `<p>Before the script...</p>`

  `<script>`
    `alert( 'Hello, world!' );`
  `</script>`

  `<p>...After the script.</p>`

`</body>`

`</html>`

The `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.

*************************************************************************

## Modern Markup

The `<script>` tag has a few attributes that are rarely used nowadays but can still be found in old code:

### The type attribute: `<script type=â€¦>`

The old HTML standard, HTML4, required a script to have a type. Usually it was type="text/javascript". Itâ€™s not required anymore. Also, the modern HTML standard, HTML5, totally changed the meaning of this attribute. Now, it can be used for JavaScript modules. But thatâ€™s an advanced topic; weâ€™ll talk about modules in another part of the tutorial.

### The language attribute: `<script language=â€¦>`
This attribute was meant to show the language of the script. This attribute no longer makes sense because JavaScript is the default language. There is no need to use it.

### Comments before and after scripts.

In really ancient books and guides, you may find comments inside `<script>` tags, like this:

`<script type="text/javascript"><!--`
    `...`
`//--></script>`
