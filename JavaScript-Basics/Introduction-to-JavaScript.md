# JavaSript Basics üí•

## An introduction to JavaSript

Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve with it, and which other technologies play well with it.

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript was initially created to ‚Äúmake web pages alive‚Äù.

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page‚Äôs HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don‚Äôt need special preparation or compilation to run.

In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
