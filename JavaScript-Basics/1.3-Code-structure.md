# JavaSript Basics 💥

## Code Structure

The first thing that we will cover is the building blocks of code.

*************************************************************************
## Statements

Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
We’ve already seen a statement, `alert('Hello, world!')`, which shows the message “Hello, world!”.


We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:


`alert('Hello'); alert('World');`


Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:

~~~~

alert('Hello');
alert('World');

~~~~
